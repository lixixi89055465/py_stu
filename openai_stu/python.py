This quickstart demonstrates how to use the Python SDK for the Gemini API, which gives you access to Google's Gemini large language models. In this quickstart, you will learn how to:

1. Set up your development environment and API access to use Gemini.
2. Generate text responses from text inputs.
3. Generate text responses from multimodal inputs (text and images).
4. Use Gemini for multi-turn conversations (chat).
5. Use embeddings for large language models.

## Prerequisites

You can run this quickstart in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/generative-ai-docs/blob/main/site/en/gemini-api/docs/get-started/python.ipynb), which runs this notebook directly in the browser and does not require additional environment configuration.

Alternatively, to complete this quickstart locally, ensure that your development environment meets the following requirements:

-  Python 3.9+
-  An installation of `jupyter` to run the notebook.

## Setup

### Install the Python SDK

The Python SDK for the Gemini API, is contained in the [`google-generativeai`](https://pypi.org/project/google-generativeai/) package. Install the dependency using pip:
"""

!pip install -q -U google-generativeai

"""### Import packages

Import the necessary packages.
"""

from google.colab import userdata

"""### Setup your API key

Before you can use the Gemini API, you must first obtain an API key. If you don't already have one, create a key with one click in Google AI Studio.

<a class="button button-primary" href="https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get an API key</a>

Note that depending on where you are located, you might have to [enable billing](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/billing#enable-cloud-billing) since the free tier is not available in [EEA (including EU), the UK, and CH](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/billing#is-Gemini-free-in-EEA-UK-CH)

In Colab, add the key to the secrets manager under the "ðŸ”‘" in the left panel. Give it the name `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

Once you have the API key, pass it to the SDK. You can do this in two ways:

* Put the key in the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable (the SDK will automatically pick it up from there).
* Pass the key to `genai.configure(api_key=...)`
"""

!curl ipinfo.io

# Or use `os.getenv('GEMINI_API_KEY')` to fetch an environment variable.
GEMINI_API_KEY = 'AIzaSyCA9YEbo093KouYCBhFhXSacJ7Fgs9CAQ4'
genai.configure(api_key=GEMINI_API_KEY)

"""## List models

Now you're ready to call the Gemini API. Use `list_models` to see the available Gemini models:

* `gemini-1.5-flash`: optimized for multi-modal use-cases where speed and cost are important. This should be your go-to model.
* `gemini-1.5-pro`: optimized for high intelligence tasks, the most powerful Gemini model

The rate limit for Gemini-Flash models is 15 requests per minute (RPM) for free ([in supported countries](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/billing#is-Gemini-free-in-EEA-UK-CH)).

The `genai` package also supports the PaLM  family of models, but only the Gemini models support the generic, multimodal capabilities of the `generateContent` method.

Large language models have a context window, and the context length is often measured in terms of the **number of tokens**.

In the simplest case, you can pass a query string to the `GenerativeModel.count_tokens` method as follows:
"""

"""Similarly, you can check `token_count` for your `ChatSession`:"""

model.count_tokens(chat.history)

"""## Advanced use cases

The following sections discuss advanced use cases and lower-level details of the Python SDK for the Gemini API.

### Use embeddings

[Embedding](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#embedding-vector) is a technique used to represent information as a list of floating point numbers in an array. With Gemini, you can represent text (words, sentences, and blocks of text) in a vectorized form, making it easier to compare and contrast embeddings. For example, two texts that share a similar subject matter or sentiment should have similar embeddings, which can be identified through mathematical comparison techniques such as cosine similarity. For more on how and why you should use embeddings, refer to the [Embeddings guide](https://ai.google.dev/docs/embeddings_guide).

Use the `embed_content` method to generate embeddings. The method handles embedding for the following tasks (`task_type`):

Task Type | Description
---       | ---
RETRIEVAL_QUERY	| Specifies the given text is a query in a search/retrieval setting.
RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT | Specifies the given text is a document in a search/retrieval setting. Using this task type requires a `title`.
SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY	| Specifies the given text will be used for Semantic Textual Similarity (STS).
CLASSIFICATION	| Specifies that the embeddings will be used for classification.
CLUSTERING	| Specifies that the embeddings will be used for clustering.

The following generates an embedding for a single string for document retrieval:
"""

result = genai.embed_content(
    model="models/text-embedding-004",
    content="What is the meaning of life?",
    task_type="retrieval_document",
    title="Embedding of single string",
)

# 1 input > 1 vector output
print(str(result["embedding"])[:50], "... TRIMMED]")

"""Note: The `retrieval_document` task type is the only task that accepts a title.

To handle batches of strings, pass a list of strings in `content`:
"""

result = genai.embed_content(
    model="models/text-embedding-004",
    content=[
        "What is the meaning of life?",
        "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck?",
        "How does the brain work?",
    ],
    task_type="retrieval_document",
    title="Embedding of list of strings",
)

# A list of inputs > A list of vectors output
for v in result["embedding"]:
    print(str(v)[:50], "... TRIMMED ...")

"""While the `genai.embed_content` function accepts simple strings or lists of strings, it is actually built around the `genai.protos.Content` type (like <a href="https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/GenerativeModel#generate_content"><code>GenerativeModel.generate_content</code></a>). `genai.protos.Content` objects are the primary units of conversation in the API.

While the `genai.protos.Content` object is multimodal, the `embed_content` method only supports text embeddings. This design gives the API the *possibility* to expand to multimodal embeddings.
"""

response.candidates[0].content

result = genai.embed_content(
    model="models/text-embedding-004", content=response.candidates[0].content
)

# 1 input > 1 vector output
print(str(result["embedding"])[:50], "... TRIMMED ...")

"""Similarly, the chat history contains a list of `genai.protos.Content` objects, which you can pass directly to the `embed_content` function:"""

chat.history

result = genai.embed_content(model="models/text-embedding-004", content=chat.history)

# 1 input > 1 vector output
for i, v in enumerate(result["embedding"]):
    print(str(v)[:50], "... TRIMMED...")

"""### Safety settings

The `safety_settings` argument lets you configure what the model blocks and allows in both prompts and responses. By default, safety settings block content with medium and/or high probability of being unsafe content across all dimensions. Learn more about [Safety settings](https://ai.google.dev/docs/safety_setting).

Enter a questionable prompt and run the model with the default safety settings, and it will not return any candidates:
"""

response = model.generate_content("[Questionable prompt here]")
response.candidates

"""The `prompt_feedback` will tell you which safety filter blocked the prompt:"""

response.prompt_feedback

"""Now provide the same prompt to the model with newly configured safety settings, and you may get a response."""

response = model.generate_content(
    "[Questionable prompt here]", safety_settings={"HARASSMENT": "block_none"}
)
response.text

"""Also note that each candidate has its own `safety_ratings`, in case the prompt passes but the individual responses fail the safety checks.

### Encode messages

The previous sections relied on the SDK to make it easy for you to send prompts to the API. This section offers a fully-typed equivalent to the previous example, so you can better understand the lower-level details regarding how the SDK encodes messages.

The [`google.generativeai.protos`](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/protos) submodule provides access to the low level classes used by the API behind the scenes:

The SDK attempts to convert your message to a `genai.protos.Content` object, which contains a list of `genai.protos.Part` objects that each contain either:

1. a <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/text/api_docs/python/text"><code>text</code></a> (string)
2. `inline_data` (`genai.protos.Blob`), where a blob contains binary `data` and a `mime_type`.

You can also pass any of these classes as an equivalent dictionary.

Note: The only accepted mime types are some image types, `image/*`.

So, the fully-typed equivalent to the previous example is:
"""

model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-flash")
response = model.generate_content(
    genai.protos.Content(
        parts=[
            genai.protos.Part(
                text="Write a short, engaging blog post based on this picture."
            ),
            genai.protos.Part(
                inline_data=genai.protos.Blob(
                    mime_type="image/jpeg", data=pathlib.Path("image.jpg").read_bytes()
                )
            ),
        ],
    ),
    stream=True,
)

response.resolve()

to_markdown(response.text[:100] + "... [TRIMMED] ...")

"""### Multi-turn conversations

While the `genai.ChatSession` class shown earlier can handle many use cases, it does make some assumptions. If your use case doesn't fit into this chat implementation it's good to remember that `genai.ChatSession` is just a wrapper around <a href="https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/GenerativeModel#generate_content"><code>GenerativeModel.generate_content</code></a>. In addition to single requests, it can handle multi-turn conversations.

The individual messages are `genai.protos.Content` objects or compatible dictionaries, as seen in previous sections. As a dictionary, the message requires `role` and `parts` keys. The `role` in a conversation can either be the `user`, which provides the prompts, or `model`, which provides the responses.

Pass a list of `genai.protos.Content` objects and it will be treated as multi-turn chat:
"""
